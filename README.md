# melodate

### _find your love at first note_

**melodate** is a mobile web app experience that allows the user to discover new artists √† la online dating ‚ú®üé∂

## motivation

melodate came about as a way for me to automate and enhance my process in looking for new music. before building this product -- i would go to spotify, click on an aritst, go through each of their related artists, take some of _those_ artists' songs, and add the songs to a playlist. i grew tired of performing all these steps manually, and thus, the idea for melodate was born!

## experience

the melodate experience is unique to each user! the application prompts the user to log in through spotify, which it leverages to get the user's top artists in the last month. the app then shuffles through those artists' related artists, and presents them in the swipe-right, swipe-left format some of us have gotten (too) familiar with. the user can view each artist's genres and top song, allowing him/her to determine whether the artist is hot ‚ô•Ô∏èÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è or not ‚ùå‚¨ÖÔ∏è. the app also allows the user to follow the spotify accounts and/or make a playlist of the top songs of the artists they swiped right on.

## tech used

- [spotify api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [remix](https://remix.run/)

## fun facts

- i have zero experience with dating apps.
- this app was (un)originally called _spinder_ in early design stages. like... spotify tinder. sigh.
- i had actually built this app [before](https://github.com/marielpacada/melodate)! in its first iteration, melodate was completely built with html and express. i decided to rebuild the app because i wanted to practice my react + remix skills.
